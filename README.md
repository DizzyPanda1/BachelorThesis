## Introduction
In recent years, the significance of sustainability in business management has grown exponentially. Driven by regulatory pressure and consumer demand, firms are increasingly expected to improve their environmental and social standards alongside their economic performance. With the rise of stakeholder theory by Freeman & Mcvea (2001), companies began incorporating sustainability considerations into their decision-making processes, aiming to balance the interests of shareholders with those of stakeholders. Post the 2008 financial crisis, sustainability reporting emerged as a tool for firms to demonstrate compliance with governance standards and disclose their environmental and social impacts. Now, as of 2023, sustainability reporting has become commonplace, mandated by regulations such as the EU's Non-Financial Reporting Directive.

However, a challenge arises with sustainability reporting: the propensity for firms to overstate their sustainability achievements, leading to discrepancies between disclosure and actual performance. This can erode stakeholder trust and damage a company's reputation. Therefore, there is a need to identify and address these discrepancies. This project aims to investigate the relationship between the extent of sustainability reporting and a firm's actual sustainability performance to provide insights for investors, regulators, and managers.

## Methodology
### Research Question
This study seeks to investigate the impact of Sustainability Disclosure Quantity on a firm's actual sustainability performance, focusing on the number and type of topics mentioned in sustainability reports and their correlation with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings.

### Variables
The dependent variable is the firm's actual ESG performance, measured using Bloomberg's ESG ratings. Independent variables include the number of mentions of each topic identified using BERTopic model. Control variables account for company revenues, industry differences, and document length.

### Data Sources
Sustainability reports will be sourced from major Italian companies' websites, while Bloomberg terminal provides ESG ratings data, ensuring objectivity and independence.

### Data Processing Steps
1. Gathering sustainability reports from the major listed Italian companies, which have been publishing sustainability reports on a voluntary basis from 2017 to 2021.
2. Fetch ESG scores from Bloomberg terminal
3. Converting PDFs to plain text using ‘pdfplumber’ python library
4. Parsing the text and cleaning from special characters
5. Using sentence-transformer tokenizer to divide text into sentences, creating a Pandas DataFrame to store each sentence and the name of the document from which it was extracted
6. Using the same process to tokenize text, we create embeddings with sentence-transformers
7. Using countvectorizer to transform each sentence into a vector containing 300 values from 0 to 1.
8. Using UMAP library to reduce the number of dimensions from 300 to 15 for the actual analysis and to 3 dimensions for data visualization, to visually check the relation between the data points.
9. Using HDBSCAN for fast data clustering
10. Finally, using BERTopic for labeling data and extract topic labels, removing the ones with low certainty.
11. As some of the topics recognized do not provide useful information we can remove them, for instance one of the clusters is related to page number.
12. We keep only the most frequent topics generated by BERTopic and remove those that contain noise.
13. We store these results in a DataFrame containing both the by the total number of sentences per topic and the total number of labeled sentences in each document.
14. As expected, we obtain a DataFrame object with on each row the sustainability report for a company in a given year, with as many columns as the topics found plus the control variables.
15. We implement OLS and Ridge regression to investigate the relationship.

## Conclusions and Discussion
The study, conducted on 20 Italian listed companies over five years, found a positive link between the extent of sustainability reporting and actual performance, particularly in social and governance aspects. However, a negative correlation was observed in environmental ratings, indicating potential discrepancies. Further analysis is warranted to explore specific topics' effects and detect greenwashing practices. The study's findings hold implications for performance evaluation, investor decisions, stakeholder engagement, risk management, and regulatory compliance.
